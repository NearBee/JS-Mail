# Project 3 - Mail
### Brief Description:  [Video Demo](https://youtu.be/Ya5ijSSJM8o)
In this project we were assigned the job of creating a front-end view of a sample email website using primarily [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), though there is a little bit of (premade) [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), and [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML).

## Mailbox:
At the very start of the project we were tasked with creating a mailbox view where the user could see the emails they have recieved (whether that be Inbox view, sent emails, archived emails, etc.) within this view the user could see whether of not they have read the email (emails with a gray background) or have not (emails with a white background).

## View Email:
Users have the ability to view emails simply by clicking anywhere within the element that contains the information for the email, when they have done so they will be brought to a view that shows everything that a user would want to see such as:
- Sender
- Recipient
- Subject
- Timestamp of when the email was sent
- Body Contents

Users are also presented with two buttons to either Reply or Archive the message (or Unarchive if the message has already been archived).

## Compose Email:
Users also have the ability to create an email from scratch using the "Compose" button located at the top of the screen, in this view the logged in user will choose who the email will be sent to (other valid email addresses), the subject of the email, and the body contents of the email.

## Reply Email:
Finally the user has the ability to create a reply email by clicking "Reply" in an already existing email, when this is done the contents of the first email will be copied over to a new compose email view with everything that could be relavent in a reply email including a separated section that shows the message of the previous email as well.

This project was a fun way to get started with using Javascript and I look forward to doing more like it. Thank you for reading my README!
